# Emilio Sayun - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Emilio Sayun! I have an analytical background in finance, operations, and marketing. I've recently completed my MSc in Management and Business Analytics, where I gained valuable expertise in these fields and developed a strong interest in using data to derive meaningful insights. As a data analyst / science professional, I'm excited to apply my technical and analytical skills to data analytics and science.

Throughout my education, I improved my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen sense of identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable in my role as a data analyst.

This repository is designed to showcase my skills, share my projects, and track my progress in areas related to Data Analytics and Data Science.

## Projects
#### Predicting and Understanding Spanish Wine Ratings

Goal: To predict and understand the factors influencing Spanish wine ratings.

**Description**: This project analyzed a Spanish wine dataset, including winery, wine type, region, year, price, and ratings. It involved data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore distributions, outliers, and correlations. Machine learning models (linear regression, random forest, neural networks) and statistical methods (Pearson correlation, OLS regression) were used to predict wine prices and ratings and identify key predictors.

Skills: data cleaning, data preprocessing, EDA, machine learning, statistical analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow.

Results: The analysis demonstrated that wine ratings and certain characteristics, such as vintage and acidity, significantly influence wine prices. The random forest model provided the best performance in predicting wine prices, while neural networks were effective in capturing complex patterns within the data.

### IMDB Sentiment Analysis 

Goal: To predict the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews.

Description: This project analyzed IMDb reviews to classify them as positive or negative. It involved data cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. Machine learning models like regression trees and random forests were used to predict sentiment, with text mining techniques like TF-IDF improving accuracy.

Skills: text preprocessing, NLP, EDA, machine learning, feature engineering, model evaluation.

Technology: R, Tidytext, Dplyr, RandomForest.

Results: The random forest model achieved a 4.24% test set error rate, effectively classifying reviews.
